      "- `WHERE e.id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Salary_Payments WHERE date > now() - interval '3 months')`: This filters the joined table to only include employees who have received salary payments in the last three months. It does this by checking if the employee's id is in the list of employee_ids in the Salary_Payments table where the payment date is within the last three months.\n",
